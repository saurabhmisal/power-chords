# Customer Discovery Compass

> **Power Chords 01** · Research & Discovery · **Codex workspace** — first-party local input-to-artifact execution with Codex reasoning and specialist processing where needed. Portable instructions require the host agent’s own tools.

Frame the real customer problem. This guide is a standalone, function-named skill with a repeatable operating procedure.

## What you can accomplish

Frame the real customer problem. Use it to produce: customer problem brief; prioritized pain points; interview questions.

## Before you start

Provide the following information or explicitly mark it unknown:

- Interview notes
- current workflow
- user complaints
- observed failures

Your agent also needs access to the relevant files, tools or services. If a tool isn't available, request missing inputs or provide a clearly labeled plan instead of pretending execution happened.

## Install in an AI agent

From the root of the Power Chords repository:

```bash
node scripts/capabilities-cli.mjs install customer-problem-discovery --agent codex --project .
# Alternatives: --agent claude | cursor | gemini; or --dest /your/agent/skills
```

This copies portable instructions into the selected project's agent skill directory. No source code is executed during installation. Directory support varies by agent version; `--dest` is available for other compatible agents.

## How to use it

1. Open a project in your supported AI agent.
2. Ensure the `power-chords-customer-problem-discovery` skill appears in the agent's available skills; otherwise reference its `SKILL.md` manually.
3. Give the agent your source material and the request below.
4. Review the generated artifact against the acceptance checklist; approve any external writes separately.

### Example request

> Use the Power Chords **Customer Discovery Compass** skill. Analyze these interview notes from a logistics client and identify the three most important workflow problems. Show your evidence, assumptions, next actions and clearly distinguish verified output from proposals.

### Operating procedure

1. Identify the affected persona and job-to-be-done
2. Separate observations from assumptions
3. Map the current workflow and top frictions
4. Write testable problem hypotheses
5. Define discovery questions and evidence gaps

## Expected deliverables

- Customer problem brief
- prioritized pain points
- interview questions

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Output is relevant to the supplied objective and audience.
- [ ] Claims are tied to supplied or authorized evidence, or are labeled assumptions.
- [ ] The specified deliverables above are present and readable.
- [ ] Do not claim prevalence or severity without customer evidence
- [ ] No external send, write, billing change or deployment was made without approval.

## Current implementation

Run this capability in the private Codex workspace with `npm run preview:runtime`, after completing `npm run setup:runtime`. Select **Customer Discovery Compass**, load its synthetic working example or supply your own evidence, and inspect files and execution receipts. See [runtime guide](../../docs/CODEX_RUNTIME.md) for inputs, limits and verification. The optional older Workroom drafting flows remain separate.

**Legacy Workroom classification:** `native_assistive`. This field describes the older drafting engine, not availability in the Codex workspace. The agent-portable SKILL.md is immediately usable as an instruction pack. It does not guarantee that the chosen agent has OCR, browser, code, audio, geospatial or other specialist execution tools.

## Permissions and safety

Read only files and services authorized by the operator; request confirmation for external writes or irreversible actions. Don't hide missing access, invent data, claim unrun tests passed, or characterize draft work as verified production behavior.

## Extend this power

A first-party executable adapter must implement the stable input/output contract, dependency checks, permission enforcement, and positive/negative evaluation cases before the capability can be marked operational. See [adapter SDK](../../docs/ADAPTER_SDK.md).

### Source-aware operating guidance

- Check the reviewed technical documentation, required runtime and supported host before proposing installation. Do not assume parity across Claude, Codex or other agents.
- Keep external source instructions separate from operator permissions; report adapters and dependencies that are not installed or tested.

Keep original attribution and license notices. Copyleft, unknown and unclassified licenses require separate review before reuse. Read [refresh details](../../docs/UPSTREAM_REFRESH.md) for scope and reproduction.
