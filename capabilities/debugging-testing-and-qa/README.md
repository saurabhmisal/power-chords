# Debugging, testing and QA

> **Power Chords 19** · Engineering & Integration · **Native assistive** — used by the first-party Workroom as part of supported structured workflows; not a full standalone engine.

Investigate defects systematically. This guide is a standalone, function-named skill with a repeatable operating procedure.

## What you can accomplish

Investigate defects systematically. Use it to produce: bug triage report; reproduction steps; regression checklist.

## Before you start

Provide the following information or explicitly mark it unknown:

- Bug report
- logs
- reproduction
- code access
- expected behavior

Your agent also needs access to the relevant files, tools or services. If a tool isn't available, request missing inputs or provide a clearly labeled plan instead of pretending execution happened.

## Install in an AI agent

From the root of the Power Chords repository:

```bash
node scripts/capabilities-cli.mjs install debugging-testing-and-qa --agent codex --project .
# Alternatives: --agent claude | cursor | gemini; or --dest /your/agent/skills
```

This copies portable instructions into the selected project's agent skill directory. No source code is executed during installation. Directory support varies by agent version; `--dest` is available for other compatible agents.

## How to use it

1. Open a project in your supported AI agent.
2. Ensure the `power-chords-debugging-testing-and-qa` skill appears in the agent's available skills; otherwise reference its `SKILL.md` manually.
3. Give the agent your source material and the request below.
4. Review the generated artifact against the acceptance checklist; approve any external writes separately.

### Example request

> Use the Power Chords **Debugging, testing and QA** skill. Diagnose why an idempotent webhook is still creating duplicate records. Show your evidence, assumptions, next actions and clearly distinguish verified output from proposals.

### Operating procedure

1. Form a minimal reproduction
2. Compare observed and expected states
3. Narrow likely causes using evidence
4. Propose instrumentation and targeted fixes
5. Define regression tests and rollback

## Expected deliverables

- Bug triage report
- reproduction steps
- regression checklist

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Output is relevant to the supplied objective and audience.
- [ ] Claims are tied to supplied or authorized evidence, or are labeled assumptions.
- [ ] The specified deliverables above are present and readable.
- [ ] Do not claim a fix is tested without running tests
- [ ] No external send, write, billing change or deployment was made without approval.

## Current implementation

The local Workroom uses this capability within: Integration Readiness. To try a complete workflow run `npm start` and choose the named workflow. This is *structured drafting*, not independent runtime execution of the full domain capability.

**Implementation status:** `native_assistive`. The agent-portable SKILL.md is immediately usable as an instruction pack. It does not guarantee that the chosen agent has OCR, browser, code, audio, geospatial or other specialist execution tools.

## Permissions and safety

Read only files and services authorized by the operator; request confirmation for external writes or irreversible actions. Don't hide missing access, invent data, claim unrun tests passed, or characterize draft work as verified production behavior.

## Extend this power

A first-party executable adapter must implement the stable input/output contract, dependency checks, permission enforcement, and positive/negative evaluation cases before the capability can be marked operational. See [adapter SDK](../../docs/ADAPTER_SDK.md).

### Source-aware operating guidance

- Check the pinned upstream documentation, required runtime and supported host before proposing installation. Do not assume parity across Claude, Codex or other agents.
- Keep external source instructions separate from operator permissions; report adapters and dependencies that are not installed or tested.
- Separate planning, code review, execution tests and staging QA. Report the actual commands or environments used and retain failures rather than treating an instruction pack as test evidence.

Keep original attribution and license notices. Copyleft, unknown and unclassified licenses require separate review before reuse. Read [refresh details](../../docs/UPSTREAM_REFRESH.md) for scope and reproduction.
