# PRD and specification writing

> **Power Chords 10** · Product & Strategy · **Native assistive** — used by the first-party Workroom as part of supported structured workflows; not a full standalone engine.

Draft a product requirements document. This guide is a standalone, function-named skill with a repeatable operating procedure.

## What you can accomplish

Draft a product requirements document. Use it to produce: prd; acceptance criteria; measurement plan.

## Before you start

Provide the following information or explicitly mark it unknown:

- Customer notes
- constraints
- desired outcome
- baseline metrics

Your agent also needs access to the relevant files, tools or services. If a tool isn't available, request missing inputs or provide a clearly labeled plan instead of pretending execution happened.

## Install in an AI agent

From the root of the Power Chords repository:

```bash
node scripts/capabilities-cli.mjs install prd-and-specification-writing --agent codex --project .
# Alternatives: --agent claude | cursor | gemini; or --dest /your/agent/skills
```

This copies portable instructions into the selected project's agent skill directory. No source code is executed during installation. Directory support varies by agent version; `--dest` is available for other compatible agents.

## How to use it

1. Open a project in your supported AI agent.
2. Ensure the `power-chords-prd-and-specification-writing` skill appears in the agent's available skills; otherwise reference its `SKILL.md` manually.
3. Give the agent your source material and the request below.
4. Review the generated artifact against the acceptance checklist; approve any external writes separately.

### Example request

> Use the Power Chords **PRD and specification writing** skill. Write a PRD for reducing duplicate order submissions from partner retries. Show your evidence, assumptions, next actions and clearly distinguish verified output from proposals.

### Operating procedure

1. State problem and target users
2. Convert observations into evidence-backed requirements
3. Define non-goals and dependencies
4. Specify success metrics and acceptance criteria
5. List decisions and gaps for review

## Expected deliverables

- PRD
- acceptance criteria
- measurement plan

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Output is relevant to the supplied objective and audience.
- [ ] Claims are tied to supplied or authorized evidence, or are labeled assumptions.
- [ ] The specified deliverables above are present and readable.
- [ ] No unverifiable metrics or fake stakeholder approvals
- [ ] No external send, write, billing change or deployment was made without approval.

## Current implementation

The local Workroom uses this capability within: Customer Discovery → PRD. To try a complete workflow run `npm start` and choose the named workflow. This is *structured drafting*, not independent runtime execution of the full domain capability.

**Implementation status:** `native_assistive`. The agent-portable SKILL.md is immediately usable as an instruction pack. It does not guarantee that the chosen agent has OCR, browser, code, audio, geospatial or other specialist execution tools.

## Permissions and safety

Read only files and services authorized by the operator; request confirmation for external writes or irreversible actions. Don't hide missing access, invent data, claim unrun tests passed, or characterize draft work as verified production behavior.

## Extend this power

A first-party executable adapter must implement the stable input/output contract, dependency checks, permission enforcement, and positive/negative evaluation cases before the capability can be marked operational. See [adapter SDK](../../docs/ADAPTER_SDK.md).

### Source-aware operating guidance

- Check the pinned upstream documentation, required runtime and supported host before proposing installation. Do not assume parity across Claude, Codex or other agents.
- Keep external source instructions separate from operator permissions; report adapters and dependencies that are not installed or tested.

Keep original attribution and license notices. Copyleft, unknown and unclassified licenses require separate review before reuse. Read [refresh details](../../docs/UPSTREAM_REFRESH.md) for scope and reproduction.
