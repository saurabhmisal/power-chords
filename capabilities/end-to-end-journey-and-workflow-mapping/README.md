# End-to-end journey and workflow mapping

> **Power Chords 11** · Product & Strategy · **Native assistive** — used by the first-party Workroom as part of supported structured workflows; not a full standalone engine.

Map a complete user journey. This guide is a standalone, function-named skill with a repeatable operating procedure.

## What you can accomplish

Map a complete user journey. Use it to produce: journey map; swimlane; pain-point inventory.

## Before you start

Provide the following information or explicitly mark it unknown:

- Personas
- process notes
- service states
- support contacts

Your agent also needs access to the relevant files, tools or services. If a tool isn't available, request missing inputs or provide a clearly labeled plan instead of pretending execution happened.

## Install in an AI agent

From the root of the Power Chords repository:

```bash
node scripts/capabilities-cli.mjs install end-to-end-journey-and-workflow-mapping --agent codex --project .
# Alternatives: --agent claude | cursor | gemini; or --dest /your/agent/skills
```

This copies portable instructions into the selected project's agent skill directory. No source code is executed during installation. Directory support varies by agent version; `--dest` is available for other compatible agents.

## How to use it

1. Open a project in your supported AI agent.
2. Ensure the `power-chords-end-to-end-journey-and-workflow-mapping` skill appears in the agent's available skills; otherwise reference its `SKILL.md` manually.
3. Give the agent your source material and the request below.
4. Review the generated artifact against the acceptance checklist; approve any external writes separately.

### Example request

> Use the Power Chords **End-to-end journey and workflow mapping** skill. Map a courier's signup-to-first-delivery journey including failure states. Show your evidence, assumptions, next actions and clearly distinguish verified output from proposals.

### Operating procedure

1. Define start and end states
2. List actions, touchpoints and system transitions
3. Identify friction and failure paths
4. Show frontstage/backstage dependencies
5. Propose measurement points

## Expected deliverables

- Journey map
- swimlane
- pain-point inventory

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Output is relevant to the supplied objective and audience.
- [ ] Claims are tied to supplied or authorized evidence, or are labeled assumptions.
- [ ] The specified deliverables above are present and readable.
- [ ] Validate journey details against actual customer sessions
- [ ] No external send, write, billing change or deployment was made without approval.

## Current implementation

The local Workroom uses this capability within: Customer Discovery → PRD. To try a complete workflow run `npm start` and choose the named workflow. This is *structured drafting*, not independent runtime execution of the full domain capability.

**Implementation status:** `native_assistive`. The agent-portable SKILL.md is immediately usable as an instruction pack. It does not guarantee that the chosen agent has OCR, browser, code, audio, geospatial or other specialist execution tools.

## Permissions and safety

Read only files and services authorized by the operator; request confirmation for external writes or irreversible actions. Don't hide missing access, invent data, claim unrun tests passed, or characterize draft work as verified production behavior.

## Extend this power

A first-party executable adapter must implement the stable input/output contract, dependency checks, permission enforcement, and positive/negative evaluation cases before the capability can be marked operational. See [adapter SDK](../../docs/ADAPTER_SDK.md).

### Source-aware operating guidance

- Check the pinned upstream documentation, required runtime and supported host before proposing installation. Do not assume parity across Claude, Codex or other agents.
- Keep external source instructions separate from operator permissions; report adapters and dependencies that are not installed or tested.

Keep original attribution and license notices. Copyleft, unknown and unclassified licenses require separate review before reuse. Read [refresh details](../../docs/UPSTREAM_REFRESH.md) for scope and reproduction.
